# MSBD566

Coursework repository for **MSBD566 – Predictive Modeling and Analytics**.

## Repository Structure
```
MSBD566/
└── Assignment 1/
    ├── MSBD566_Davis_LaPorchia_Assignment1.ipynb            # Jupyter notebook for Part 1 (with your updates)
    └── Air_Quality_and_Pollen_Count.csv # Dataset used in the notebook
```

## Assignment 1
- **Part 1 (Pandas):** Data exploration, plotting, AQI analysis, pollen analysis, and vectorization vs. manual timing.
- **Part 2 (GitHub):** Organize code/data in this repo with clear structure and documentation.

### How to run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter (Lab/Notebook).
2. Ensure the CSV is in the same `Assignment 1/` folder.
3. Run cells top-to-bottom; fill in any remaining TODOs and written answers.

### Notes
- Plots should have clear titles, axis labels, and readable ticks.
- For timing comparisons, use the `time` module as demonstrated in your notebook.
- Keep your narrative answers concise and data-driven.
